# Procedural Cave Generation
This repository contains the a Procedural Cave Generation project I have created.
This cave generation underlies the concept and process of Cellular Automata. In consise, the process involves transforming with respect to it's neighbouring tiles to organize random noise into desired patterns.

# Examples

This was created in [Unity3D](https://unity.com/).

The Unity build files have been included in the repo, to run this, clone the repo and run the 'Cave.exe' build file.
This should open a window with a sample cave generated, left click to generate more.

I have also included the Unity script files for reference, there are quite a few additional features I have implemented not exactly relevant to the highlighted functionality which can be ignored.
