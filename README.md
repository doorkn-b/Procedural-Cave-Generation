# Procedural Cave Generation
This repository contains the a Procedural Cave Generation project I have created for GSOC'23 MLPack.

This cave generation underlies the concept and process of Cellular Automata.

In consise, the process involves transforming with respect to it's neighbouring tiles.

Here is an example gif of the results it can reproduce.

This was created in [Unity3D](https://unity.com/).

The Unity build files have been included in the repo, to run this, clone the repo and run the 'Cave.exe' build file.

This should open a window with a sample cave generated, left click to generate more.
